# Towards General-purpose Active Learning Policies for Constrained Optimization Problems
This repo provides an implementation for a `TestFunction` class that can take on the identity of all the test functions used in the paper. The class contains methods for making function/constraint calls and accessing properties of the function.

**Authors**: Y. Elia Altabet and Jingyi Guo <br />

**Note**: Code uses relative imports, so any code that uses the `TestFunction` class must be run as a module
